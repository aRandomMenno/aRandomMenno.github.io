          I'm Menno, <span class="ag">18</span>, a Software Development student at GLR. I mostly code in
          <span class="php">PHP</span> and <span class="js">JavaScript</span> (and a bit of
          <span class="py">Python</span>), use <span class="git">Git/GitHub</span> and <span class="linux">Linux</span>
          daily, and for school I'm researching languages like <span class="kotlin">Kotlin</span>/
          <span class="java">Java</span> and <span class="rs">Rust</span>/Go. Besides coding I enjoy photography; later
          I want to move towards <span class="cyb-sec">cyber security</span>/ethical hacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website. I'm <span class="ag">18</span> years old and studying software development @ GLR
          (<a href="https://www.glr.nl/" target="_blank" class="link underline-anim">Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</a>). I'm
          in my second year out of the three years it will take.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming and Tech</h2>
        <p>
          At the moment I am fairly good at 3 programming languages. The language I am best at in my opinion is
          <span class="php">PHP</span> after which comes <span class="js">JavaScript</span> and then
          <span class="py">Python</span>. My Python currently needs work since I have not used it since I've made my
          "simple" project to automate part of a mobile game I used to play. For school I am currently researching 4
          different programming languages. <span class="kotlin">Kotlin</span> vs <span class="java">Java</span> for a
          Minecraft mod or <span class="rs">Rust</span> vs Go to make a chess engine. After some time I'll have to
          choose one of these languages and at the time of writing this I'm leaning towards Rust.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been using JavaScript for about two and a half years now and I feel pretty confident with it. I can
          easily modify the <span class="js">DOM</span>, use <span class="js">Fetch</span> to get data from API's and
          create <span class="js">Asynchronous</span> scripts. And I also know a good bit about 2 frameworks.
          <span class="js">P5.js</span> and <span class="js">GSAP</span>. As for PHP I have experience with
          <span class="php">PHPMyAdmin</span> and <span class="php">MariaDB</span> databases. I have made multiple small
          projects using PHP and databases. We first started learning PHP with a simple <span class="php">Sqlite</span>
          database but later on we moved to using <span class="php">MariaDB</span> databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="git">Git</span>, <span class="git">GitHub</span> and <span class="linux">Linux</span> are also
          things I am familiar with. I use Git for all my projects, even for school projects to track what changes I
          made and when. On GitHub I have <i>some</i> repositories with code in them. Only a couple of them are private.
          As for Linux I have been using it as my main OS for about a year and a half now. I am also using Linux on my
          Raspberry Pi to host OwnTracks and I am planning on hosting a NextCloud instance in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I like to do in my spare time are listening to music, gaming, sleeping, and
          <span class="pictures">taking pictures</span>. I have taken a photography course to learn more about it, and I
          really enjoy taking photographs. You can find some of my photos in my
          <a href="gallery/" class="link underline-anim">gallery</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>The future</h2>
        <p>
          After my current study I'd like to study <span class="cyb-sec">Cyber Security</span>. Focusing on ethical
          hacking, Network defense or working to fight Social Engineering. And if the tech world does not work out for
          me I can always try to go in on <span class="photo">photography</span> since I also really like that.
