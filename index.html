      <h1 id="greetings">"Greetings, internet traveler! My name is <n>Menno</n>.</h1>
      <p>
        And welcome to my little pebble on the internet! I'm <span id="age">17 (this might be outdated)</span> years old
        and live in the Netherland Near Rotterdam. Currently I am studying Software Development (3 year course), my two
        most used coding languages are <pr>JavaScript</pr> and <pr>PHP</pr>. Which I wish to change but do not have
        the motivation for, as the world is currently destroying itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        For School we are still learning about web development however due to the Minor I chose to do (Applied
        Development) I'll be learning to make websites with ASP.NET (C# and Razor). I do not know yet how I feel about
        that just yet. What I do know is that it's made by Microsoft, so I already have a grudge against the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other things I like to do in my spare time include but are not limited to sleeping, gaming and coding. I'm
        actually pretty boring, I know. There's also a reason why this website looks pretty "boring", I don't like the
        way how most websites look. They're overengineered and take up megabytes of bandwidth just to show a few images
        and some text, I know that this website is not Facebook/Meta or YouTube but those website are so slow. I hate
        the current state of the internet, it's just a mess of 99% AI, Ads and trackers. Which this page does not have.

      <h2>Some chores</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring back the picture gallery. (didn't have the time yet)</li>
        <li>Make some sort of "blog" about random stuff I did, found or want to share.</li>
        <li>Add TL;DR before ranting.</li>
