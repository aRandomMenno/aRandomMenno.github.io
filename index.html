          Welcome to my personal website. I am <span id="age">17 (this might be outdated)</span> years old and I live in
          the Netherlands in Spijkenisse. Currently I am studying software development; I'm in my second year of three.
          My main programming languages are <pr>JavaScript</pr> and <pr>PHP</pr>. While I have experience with Python,
          I haven't used it in a while. I also have some experience with <pr>HTML</pr> and <pr>CSS</pr> for web
          development. Take a look at my <a href="projects/" class="link underline-anim">projects</a> to see what I've been working on.
          or have worked on in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my software development course I am still learning more about <pr>PHP</pr>, <pr>JavaScript</pr>, and
          <pr>CSS</pr>. This year I also started Applied Development, so I will be learning how to use <pr>ASP.NET</pr>
          (<pr>C#</pr> and <pr>Razor</pr>) to build websites with databases. After finishing my current course, I'd like
          to follow a course in cyber security so I can hopefully become an ethical hacker in the future. I also want to
          learn more programming languages like Go, Rust, and possibly C/C++. I am also interested in learning more
          about <pr>networking</pr> and <pr>cryptography</pr>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I like to do in my spare time include, but are not limited to, sleeping, gaming, coding, and <pr>taking
            pictures</pr>. I have taken a photography course to learn more about it, and I really enjoy taking
          photographs. You can find some of my photos in my <a href="gallery/" class="link underline-anim">gallery</a>.
