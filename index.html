          The TL:DR; Hey, I am 17 year old who loves coding and taking pictures. I am currently studying Software
          Development (2nd year). I mostly use JavaScript and PHP, but I would love to learn more languages like Go or
          Rust.

        And welcome to my little pebble on the internet! I'm <span id="age">17 (this might be outdated)</span> years old
        and live in the Netherland near Rotterdam. Currently I am studying Software Development (3 year course, in my
        2nd year), my two most used coding languages are <pr>JavaScript</pr> and <pr>PHP</pr>. Which I wish to change
        but do not have the motivation for, as the world is currently destroying itself. I'd like to improve my Python
        skills and learn more about cryptography.

        For school we are still learning about web development however due to the minor I chose to do (Applied
        Development) I'll be learning to make websites with <pr>ASP.NET</pr> (<pr>C#</pr> and <pr>Razor</pr>). I think
        it's an okay framework. ASP.NET is made by Microsoft, which is... not my favorite company.
      </p>

        In the future I want to follow a Cyber Security course, so I can become an ethical hacker. I also want to learn
        more programming languages, like Go, Rust and <i>maybe</i> C/C++. I already know a decent amount of Python and
        would like to keeping learning it. I also want to learn more about Linux, networking, servers and all that
        stuff. I am already selfhosting some stuff on my Raspberry Pi at home.

        Other things I like to do in my spare time include but are not limited to sleeping, gaming, coding and taking
        pictures. I'm actually pretty boring, I know. There's also a reason why this website looks pretty "boring"
        compared to other website, I don't like the way how most modern websites look. They're over engineered and take
        up megabytes of bandwidth just to show a few images and some text, I know that this website is not Facebook/Meta
        or YouTube but those website are so slow. I hate the current state of the internet, it's just a mess of 99% AI,
        Ads and trackers. And this website has none of that stuff.
