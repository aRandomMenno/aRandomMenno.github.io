        Hey, my name is Menno, I'm <span class="age">18</span> years old and I live in Spijkenisse. I love listening to
        music, coding, taking pictures, and sleeping. Currently I'm studying software development at Grafisch Lyceum,
        I'm in my second year out of the three years it will take. I have taken a photography course but I haven't done
        much photography since finishing that course.

        <p>
          Welcome to my website. I'm <span class="ag">18</span> years old and studying software development @ GLR (<a
             href="https://www.glr.nl/" target="_blank" class="link underline-anim">Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</a>). I'm
          in my second year out of the three years it will take.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I am fairly good at 3 programming languages. The language I am best at in my opinion is
          <span class="php">PHP</span> after which comes <span class="js">JavaScript</span> and then
          <span class="py">Python</span>. My Python currently needs work since I have not used it since I've made my
          "simple" project to automate part of a mobile game I used to play. For school I am currently researching 4
          different programming languages. <span class="kotlin">Kotlin</span> vs <span class="java">Java</span> for a
          Minecraft mod or <span class="rs">Rust</span> vs Go to make a chess engine. After some time I'll have to
          choose one of these languages and at the time of writing this I'm leaning towards Rust.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been using JavaScript for about 2 years now and I feel pretty confident with it. I can easily modify the
          <span class="js">DOM</span>, use <span class="js">Fetch</span> to get data from API's and create
          <span class="js">Asynchronous</span> scripts. And I also know a good bit about 2 frameworks.
          <span class="js">P5.js</span> and <span class="js">Gsap</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for PHP I have experience with <span class="php">PHPMyAdmin</span> and <span class="php">MariaDB</span>
          databases. I have made multiple small projects using PHP and databases. We first started learning PHP with a
          simple <span class="php">Sqlite</span> database but later on we moved to using
          <span class="php">MariaDB</span> databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="git">Git</span>, <span class="git">GitHub</span> and <span class="linux">Linux</span> are also
          things I am familiar with. I use Git for all my projects, even for school projects to track what changes I
          made and when. On GitHub I have <i>some</i> repositories with code in them. Only a couple of them are private.
          As for Linux I have been using it as my main OS for about a year and a half now. I am also using Linux on my
          Raspberry Pi to host OwnTracks and I am planning on hosting a NextCloud instance in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I like to do in my spare time are listening to music, gaming, sleeping, and
          <span class="pictures">taking pictures</span>. I have taken a photography course to learn more about it, and I
          really enjoy taking photographs. You can find some of my photos in my
          <a href="gallery/" class="link underline-anim">gallery</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>The future</h3>
        <p>
          After my current study I'd like to study <pr>Cyber Security</pr>. Focusing on ethical hacking, Network defense
          or Social Engineering prevention. And if the tech world does not work out for me I can always try to go in on
          photography since I also really like that.
