        Hey, my name is Menno, I'm <span class="age">18</span> years old and I live in Spijkenisse. I love listening to
        music, coding, taking pictures, and sleeping. Currently I'm studying software development at Grafisch Lyceum,
        I'm in my second year out of the three years it will take. I have taken a photography course but I haven't done
        much photography since finishing that course.

          Welcome, to my website. I'm <span class="ag">18</span>-years-old and studying software development @ GLR (<a
             href="https://www.glr.nl/" target="_blank" class="link underline-anim">Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</a>). I'm
          in my second year out the the three years it will take.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I am fairly good at 3 programming languages. The language I am best at in my opinion is <pr>PHP
          </pr> after which comes <pr>JavaScript</pr> and lastly <pr>Python</pr>. My Python is currently not that good
          since I have not used it since I've made my "simple" project to automated part of a mobile game I used to
          play. For school I am currently researching 4 different programming languages. <pr>Kotlin</pr> or <pr>Java
          </pr> for a Minecraft mod or <pr>Rust</pr> or <pr>Go</pr> to make a chess engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I like to do in my spare time include, but are not limited to listening to music, gaming, sleeping, and
          <pr>taking pictures</pr>. I have taken a photography course to learn more about it, and I really enjoy taking
          photographs. You can find some of my photos in my <a href="gallery/" class="link underline-anim">gallery</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>The future</h3>
        <p>
          After my current study I'd like to study <pr>Cyber Security</pr>. Focusing on ethical hacking, Network defense
          or Social Engineering prevention. And if the tech world does not work out for me I can always try to go in on
          photography since I also really like that.
