      <p>
        Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on, both for school and personal projects. Most of these
        projects are web based, as that is what I spend most of my time on. However in the future I hope to add some
        other projects that are not web based.
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects are <i>possibly</i> listed in chronological order, with the most recent project at the top.

        A web-based terminal emulator that mimics a Linux shell environment. It allows users to execute basic commands,
        navigate directories, and manage files in a simulated file system. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. It was made during a 48-hour make-a-thon event organized by my school. I participated with a team of
        4 other students. My sister <a href="https://github.com/astralvrz" class="link" target="_blank">Jea</a>. 2
        classmates: Stone, Rianne and Tigo and classmate of my sister. The project was a overwhelming success, we won
        (from 2 other first year teams) and won a small prize. It was a fun experience and I learned a lot about working
        in a team and about web development.

        A simple simple python script that automates the process of clicking on boxes in the evolution games from Tapps
        Games. It was originally developed for Cow Evolution, but should work work with every evolution game from Tapps
        Games. Provided you make your own screenshots. It uses PyAutoGUI to find the boxes and then move to them and
        clicks on them.

        This very website you are looking at right now! I made this website to showcase my projects and to have a
        personal space on the internet. The website is built using plain ol' HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. If
        I have correctly counted, this is the 12th version of the little website. Fact: the first commit was on Feb 13,
        2023. I have learned a lot about coding in the past years (it's 2025 now).
