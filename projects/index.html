      <p>
        Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on, both for school and personal projects. Most of these
        projects are web based, as that is what I spend most of my time on. However in the future I hope to add some
        other projects that are not web based. They are not listed in any particular order

          A web-based terminal emulator that mimics a Linux shell environment. It allows users to execute basic
          commands, navigate directories, and manage files in a simulated file system. The project is built using HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript. It was made during a 48-hour make-a-thon event organized by my school. I participated
          with a team of 4 other students. My sister <a href="https://github.com/astralvrz" class="link"
            target="_blank">Jea</a>. 2 classmates: Stone, Rianne and Tigo and classmate of my sister. The project was a
          overwhelming success, we won (from 2 other first year teams) and won a small prize. It was a fun experience
          and I learned a lot about working in a team and about web development.

          A simple simple python script that automates the process of clicking on boxes in the evolution games from
          Tapps Games. It was originally developed for Cow Evolution, but should work work with every evolution game
          from Tapps Games. Provided you make your own screenshots. It uses PyAutoGUI to find the boxes and then move to
          them and clicks on them.

          This very website you are looking at right now! I made this website to showcase my projects and to have a
          personal space on the internet. The website is built using plain ol' HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. If I
          have correctly counted, this is the 12th version of the little website. Fact: the first commit was on Feb 13,
          2023. I have learned a lot about coding in the past years (it's 2025 now).

          A simple python script to print colored and styled text from a file to your terminal! The author (my sister)
          originally created this because she wanted to show their todo list in a more visually appealing way when they
          opened their terminal, however now it can be used for any text file. I made a small contribution to the
          project by adding support to print each line with a slight delay (configurable in the file or via a command
          line flag) [-d [delay in milliseconds]]
