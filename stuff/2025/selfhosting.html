    <h1>Selfhosting on a Raspberry PI</h1>
    <h2 class="notaguide">This is not a selfhosting/server/security guide!</h2>
    <p>
      A while back now I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 8GB, with the intention of learning more about Linux and selfhosting.
      At that time I did not have any knowledge about Linux. So for the first couple of weeks I just tried doing random
      things and breaking the OS in obscure ways. After a bit I decided to reinstall Raspberry Pi OS on my Pi and start
      from scratch to Try and selfhosting some stuff. I started with Owntracks, a Private location tracking app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time I tried to install Owntracks I ran into an issue where I could not connect to my Pi from the
      outside my network. Because I didn't enable port forwarding on my router. After Correctly routing those ports to
      the ports on my Pi it worked correctly. Lucky for me I actually have a fixed IP from my ISP, so I don't have to
      use a dynamic DNS service to peridocally update my IP address. I also setup a wireguard connection from my laptop
      and phone to my Pi so I can connect to my Pi and my home network securely from anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, before all of this I first had to Harden my Pi. I just use UFW to block all incoming connections except
      for SSH and the ports I needed for Owntracks and my "VPN" connection to my PI. I also made sure that only I was
      able to login via SSH by disabling password authentication and only allowing login via SSH keys. I am also using
      Fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks, when someone tries to attack my Pi their IP will get banned for a
      certain amount of time on <b>all</b> ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future I also want to host a website on my Pi, I will have DDOS protection by then and a proper domain name
      and not host on github pages. Because GitHub page are pretty limited in what you can do with them, like you can
      not use a database or server side code. I might also host some small game servers on my Pi when I feel like it.
