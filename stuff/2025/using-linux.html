    <h1>My experience switching to Linux.</h1>
    <h2 class="notaguide">This is not a Linux guide!</h2>
    <p>
      A good while back I was getting annoyed with Windows 10 and 11 because of all the telemetry, data collection and
      forced updates. So I decided to try Linux in a VM. The first distro I tried in my VM was Linux Mint, because I
      found from looking at Reddit and other sites that it was a good distro for beginners. After experimenting with it
      for a while I decided to also try fedora in another VM. I liked fedora a bit more because it had a more modern
      look and feel. After a couple of days I decided to shrink my Windows partition and dual boot Windows and Fedora.
    </p>
    <h2>Distrohopping fase</h2>
    <p>
      After using Fedora for like 5 weeks I thought I wanted to try something else and started using Linux Mint (still
      dual boot with Windows 10). I used Linux Mint for like 2 months and 2 weeks before I <i>accidentally</i> broke
      some configs which I could not figure out how to fix. So I switched distro again. This time I chose Manjaro, I
      sort of liked Manjaro because I had access to the AUR, however I did not like that if I did <i>anything</i> wrong
      no matter how small, it broke my system. After reinstalling Manjaro 4 time within 3 weeks I decided to try move to
      another distro. Again which I stayed on for quite a while. &gt;6 months. I this time chose EndeavourOS, which is
      again based on Arch Linux. I liked EndeavourOS because it was more stable than Manjaro, and still had access to
      the AUR. After using EndeavourOS for a while I found out about NixOS, which is a very different distro. I liked 1
      thing about NixOS, the fact that there were seemingly endless packages available. However I couldn't get used to
      the way NixOS worked. So after around 3 weeks I switched back to EndeavourOS. Which I am still using to this day.
    </p>
    <h2>Desktop Environments.</h2>
    <p>
      The first desktop environment I came into contact with was Cinnamon, which is one of the options for Linux Mint.
      I kinda liked it but found that it was a tad slow and look kinda outdated. On fedora I used GNOME which was the
      default DE. I liked GNOME because it was relatively fast and modern looking. However I found that it was not very
      customizable. On Manjaro I used KDE Plasma, which I really liked because it was very simple to make big changes to
      the look and feel of the DE. However there were a <i>couple</i> of bugs here and there and a tad too many default
      apps installed for my liking, it reminded me a bit of Windows. On EndeavourOS I first chose XFCE, however
      instantly replaced it again with KDE Plasma. And after getting comfortable with Linux in general I decided to try
      a more advanced Display Manager, a Tiling Window Manager. I chose Hyprland I first had to get used to the way the
      mouse and keyboard shortcuts worked. But after a while I got used to it and now when I am using a different
      computer I try to use my Hyprland keybaord shortcuts, which obviously don't work.
